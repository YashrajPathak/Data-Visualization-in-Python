# Sales Data Visualization using Python ðŸ“ˆ
> The objective of this dashboard is to understand sales trends for one of the leading pharmaceutical company.

The client would like to come see a dynamic dashboard with different KPI's at different levels (National, Region & Territory etc). Create the below charts as these would help us explore the past data in a better manner and give a good picture of the progress and failures. This in turn would catalyse the decision-making process, making it easier, simpler
and accurate.
